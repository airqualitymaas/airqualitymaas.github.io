            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p> The following graphs on this page display all of our data. The AQM measured the varying levels of humidity, temperature, CO2, VOC, PM2.5 and PM10. The data was collected over a period of 24 hours from a project member's apartment. The graph seen below shows the entirety of the 24 hours.  </p>

          <h2>Results: Cooking</h2>
          <p>The graph below displays several peaks that occurred as a meal was being cooked in the same confined space the measurements were being taken. From the data it can be inferred that the cooking caused the increase in humidity. During the cooking, PM2.5 and PM10 values also rapidly increased, leading to the same conclusion as for the humidity.  At 13:55 a window was opened and ventilation turned on. This potentially explains the drop in temperature and the drop in CO2.

	  <h2>Results: The presence of people </h2>
	  <p>The CO2 levels decreased significantly, which could be due to the person leaving the room at around 19:15. In addition, the CO2 levels can be seen quickly rising to above 1000 ppm when the person returned to the room at around 3:30. All these trends can be observed in the figure below.</p>
