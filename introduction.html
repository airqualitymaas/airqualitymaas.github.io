      <h2>Building a carbon capture unit and an air quality sensor for quantification</h2>
      <p> Welcome to our project! We are a group of students of the Maastricht Science Programme who worked on project the “Building a carbon capture unit and an air quality sensor for quantification”. 
        Since the air quality in Maastricht is pretty bad we were looking for ways we can measure the quality and improve it on a small scale. Thus, during the 4-week project we had two main goals: 
        Building an Air Quality Monitor (AQM) and a Carbon Capture Unit (CCU). </p>
      <p> The AQM is a device that we built using an arduino microcontroller and several environmental sensors. In the next step we want to use the AQM to measure the air quality around Maastricht, 
        specifically indoors. This is mainly because there is already data on air outside, however almost no data is published on the air quality indoors around Maastricht. 
        </p> 
      <p>Moreover we built a CCU which binds carbon dioxide from the surrounding air using a reaction between potassium hydroxide and carbon. This box could be used in classrooms, 
        kindergartens or offices to reduce the CO2 concentration and improve the general air quality.
        </p>
      <p>In the future, we want to combine the AQM with the CCU so that eventually we will have a device that starts capturing carbon from the air in a room once the air quality gets too bad.
