            <h2>What is a carbon capture unit?</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Carbon Capture Unit (CCU) was to create a portable means of removing carbon dioxide. This allows the experience of carbon removal for ordinary individuals and further enables the increase of air quality in enclosed areas. It is based on a simple process in which molecules bind to CO2. This mechanism occurs inside the CCU and consists of 2 steps. First, a strong alkaline sorbent solution is put in a container inside the unit. The container has a hole on the top, where a humidifier is placed. Secondly, the humidifier sprays the alkaline solution to the air, where it reacts with carbon dioxide forming a carbonate solution which condensates on the walls and lid of the CCU. For this project, potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as the strong base solution, forming potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3).

          <h2>How the CCU was built</h2>
          <p>The CCU was built in the lab using easily accessible hardware supplies and potassium hydroxide from the chemistry lab. The design of the box was dynamic and constantly changing as challenges arose. Eventually for the final box 3D printed pieces were made to be permanently fixed to the CCU. The box was fitted with electronic sensors and humidifiers which were fully automated to ensure the box could be left functioning without constant supervision.</p>

            <h2>The design of the CCU</h2>
            <p>The design of the unit follows the construction requirements of the chemical reaction.  It is designed to have a ventilation mechanism to ensure constant flow of air and a filtering mechanism which work together. The ventilation mechanism consists of a fan attached to the side of a rectangular box. It is the only air intake for the unit besides the discharge tube, to ensure maximum suction of the surrounding air into the CCU. 

              The whole unit is angled with one of its corners as a pivot point. This ascertains that all the potassium bicarbonate flows towards the corner, which has a hole and a water tube to lead all water out of the unit. The walls and corners of the unit are coated with a hydrophobic layer to maximise water flow out. This establishes maximum autonomous working of the unit for long periods without needing maintenance.
